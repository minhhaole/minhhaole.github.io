Hello, I'm Minh-Hao ! I aim to transition into data analytic roles, drawing on over 4 years of diverse experience in project management and client operations as a bilingual Business Analyst in consulting firms. Iâ€™m driven by the ability of providing actionable insights and improve decision-making through data. My experience equips me with a deep understanding of business processes and working with complex data systems in finance.
